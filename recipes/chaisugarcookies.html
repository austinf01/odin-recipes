        <h1>Chai Sugar Cookies Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/chaisugarcookie.jpg">
        <p>These chai sugar cookies are chewy, buttery, and beautifully spicy. 
            The chai spice mix appears twice—once in the cookie dough, and then 
            in the sugar and spice mixture the dough is rolled in before baking.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h5>Chai Spice Mix:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>    
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cookie Dough</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chai spice mix</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Chai Spice - Sugar Mix:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chai spice mix</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and 
                vanilla and mix until well combined. Mix in flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the chai spice mix, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir together 1/4 cup white sugar and 2 teaspoons of the chai spice mix in a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Shape dough into 1 tablespoon-sized balls. Dough will be slightly sticky, but should still roll into a ball. 
                Roll each ball in chai spice-sugar mixture until coated. Place dough balls 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until they begin to crack on top and look slightly set, 10 to 13 minutes. 
                Cool cookies on pan for a few minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
